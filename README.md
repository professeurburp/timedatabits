# m*arket* *h*eart *b*its

python market data storage

## i*nstructions?*
who needs them anyway? just **p**_lay_

let's **d**_iscover_ what's **i**_nside_ market hearts

*too much work and no **p**lay makes jack a dull **b**oy*

## t*ech*
- _**p**ython 3.10+ tested_ so far
- _**v**env_ highly recommended

## c*oncepts*
- **d**_ry_: don't repeat yourself
- **k**_iss_: keep it simple and stupid

## w*anna help?*
any **h**_elp_ is very **a**_ppreciated_, sure

## w*anna contribute?*
this **g**_ithub_ _repo_ **i***ssues* might be a first place where to look, don't you think?

if you read this line, you should already know the repo's online location
if you still don't, it's [*there*](https://github.com/professeurburp/mktheartbits), stupid!

### c*urrent* c*ontributors*

so far, only me

## o*pinions?*

the initial author comes from a heavy **.n**_et_ background

**p**_ython_ is much more concise, easy to learn and understand even for beginners to the programming world

**p**_ython_ is nice, but it is somehow **o**_pinionated_.

**o**_pinions_ are a good thing, though, everyone should have one
shouldn't we be able to discuss ours

the heavy usage of reduced builtin **i**_terable_ functions and the **p**_ythonic_ way of writing code makes it a very likeable yet powerful language to program with

we believe in **c**_onvention_ over **r**_estriction_, similar to python _**b**etter **a**sk for **f**orgiveness than **p**ermission_

## w*anna dream?*
'cause why not?
